I am a Mechanical engineering graduate and experienced Industrial engineer, currently doing my Master's in Commerical vehicle technology with a special focus on applications of Machine learning in the field of ADAS and Autonomous Driving.

At Present, working on my master thesis with a focus on the application of Graph neural networks in decision making for autonomous vehicles. 

In addition, I am working with Rheinmetall as a working student in the Assistance and connectivity department. Also, as a Reinforcement learning research assistant for a topic on Factory layout optimization in FBK, TU Kaiserslautern.

I am proficient in Machine Learning, Data Analysis and Visualization. I am passionate about research in the areas of ADAS, Autonomous driving and Data-driven development.
